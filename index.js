        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

          + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Whenever a function is contained in the global scope, the value of 'this' inside of that function will be the window object.
    2. Whenever a function called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is 'this'.
    3. Whenever a conctructor function is used, 'this' refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
    4. Whenever JavaScript's 'call' or 'apply' method is used, this is explicity defined.
