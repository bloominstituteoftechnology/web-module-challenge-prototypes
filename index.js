  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  }
  Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
    this.isFlying = true;
  };

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 2
      - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
      - All instances built with Car:
          + should initialize with an `tank` at 0
          + should initialize with an `odometer` at 0

          + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
          + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
          + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

    TASK 3
      - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
      - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.
      - Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to `.play()`:
          + Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Window Binding- With 'this' it will return the container. that is holding the function.  
    2. Implicit Binding - it is applies to the objects with a method. The 'this' refers to the left side of the dot.
    3. New Binding - it uses the 'new' object. it involves constructor function.
    4. Explicit uses - Uses the .call(), .apply(), .bind(), The this in this as the owner.
